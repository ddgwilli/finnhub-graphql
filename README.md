# finnhub-graphql
A simple graphql wrapper I built around the https://finnhub.io/ API in a weekend. Using this project as a baseline for functionality around a code generator that I'm privately writing. The API token hard coded into the requests is not a valid token so if you pull this down, you'll have to replace it with your own token.
